- **Tool/model & version:** *ChatGPT5*
- **What I asked for:** *I got stuck trying to get the output to just be the highest GC on Task23.2. So, I asked Chat for methods of doing so.*
- **Snippet of prompt(s):** *"Here's the code i have for some analysis in GC content ... what are some way i can output just the max gc content with it's id. explain each line"*
- **What I changed before committing:** *I initialized some variables so the for loop could also shift through and ultimately identify the highest gc content.*
- **How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):** *I tested with the sample dataset + the ones from my failed attempts. Then cross checked with a list of all the gc contents to make sure it was indeed identifying the top one each time.*
